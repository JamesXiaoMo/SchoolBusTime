## Description
"校车时间" is a program used to check the next school bus in real time for students at Fukuyama University in Hiroshima, Japan.
The inspiration came from a sunny Friday afternoon. Even though I was in the classroom of the Artificial Intelligence class, my impetuous mind had already returned home.
I opened the official website of Fukuyama University to check the departure time of the next school bus.
At this time, I realized that a simple query required several clicks on the official website, which obviously did not comply with the principles of human-computer interaction.
So the inspiration for "校车时间" came into being.

At the beginning of the design, I thought "校车时间" should be an application like this:
* Quick Search
* Safety
* Simple and easy to use

So with this goal in mind, "校车时间" was born.
